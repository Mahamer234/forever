# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

🛒 E-commerce Store Project Description using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Context API
🎯 Project Overview: A modern and responsive e-commerce store that provides a smooth and fast shopping experience.
 Built using React.js for a dynamic user interface,
 Tailwind CSS for a sleek and flexible design,
and Context API for efficient state management within the application.

🛠️ Technologies Used: 
React.js ⚛️ – For building the interactive user interface.
Tailwind CSS 🎨 – For fast and responsive styling.
Context API 🌍 – For managing global state and storing cart and product data. 
React Router 🛤️ – For seamless navigation between pages.
LocalStorage 💾 – To persist cart data even after page reloads. 

🚀 Key Features:
✅ Product Listing: Displays products with images, prices, and details.
✅ Shopping Cart: Allows users to add/remove products and see the total price.
✅ Filtering & Search: Users can filter products by category or price and search for specific items.
✅ Product Details Page: Shows detailed information about a selected product. 
✅ Smooth Navigation: Implemented using React Router for a single-page experience. 
✅ Fully Responsive Design: Works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

📌 How It Works:
1️⃣ Users browse products from the homepage. 
2️⃣ They can add items to the shopping cart and see the updated item count.
3️⃣ Clicking on a product opens a detailed product page with more information.
4️⃣ Users can update the quantity or remove items from the cart. 
5️⃣ Once ready, they proceed to the checkout page to finalize their order.

🎯 Why These Technologies? 
React.js: Provides fast performance and a dynamic user experience.
Tailwind CSS: Simplifies styling without the need for additional CSS files.
Context API: Manages state efficiently without external libraries like Redux.

✨ This project is simple yet powerful, with potential enhancements like user authentication, online payment integration, and product reviews.
